## Guide

1. Copy the repository
2. Create a folder named "data" inside the copied repository
3. Create a .env file in the copied repository and add your bot token there like this:
TOKEN = Your bot token
4. Replace "Your bot token" with your actual bot token. (No quotes needed, but you can add them)
5. Done
