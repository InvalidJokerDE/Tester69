A general-use discord bot coded in discord.py

# Big shoutout to kaJob-dev on github (Jakob#2222 on discord) for guiding me on this project!

# Installation
### Requirements
- [Python 3.8 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- discord.py, version 2.1.0 or higher 
    ```bash
    # WINDOWS 
    python -m pip install -U discord.py

    # LINUX
    python3 -m pip install -U discord.py

    # MACOS
    python3 -m pip install -U discord.py
    ```
- Python Pillow (Install with pip)
    ```bash
    # WINDOWS 
    pip install pillow

    # LINUX
    pip3 install pillow

    # MACOS
    pip3 install pillow
    ```

### Guide
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the main.py file

    Running the main.py file for the first time will create a new directory named "data" and 3 new files in it. It should then ask you to enter your bot token. You can see how to get a bot token [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI4OmIbkJH8). Enter your bot token in the data/config.json file and save the file. Then run the main.py file again. It should now work.
